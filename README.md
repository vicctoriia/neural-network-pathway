**Neural Networks from the Ground Up**

This project aims to provide a comprehensive pathway for understanding the core concepts of neural networks. The primary focus is on building a  foundation by implementing neural network models from scratch. **The notebook included in this repository takes inspiration from the tutorial by Denny Britz on implementing a neural network from scratch, which can be found <a href="https://dennybritz.com/posts/wildml/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/" target="_blank">here</a>**.

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and open the provided Jupyter Notebook (nn-from-the-ground-up.ipynb). 

To demonstrate the concepts, the make_circles dataset is used. This dataset poses a non-linear separation challenge, making it an ideal candidate to showcase the power of neural networks. You will build a 3-layer neural network from scratch. The network consists of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
